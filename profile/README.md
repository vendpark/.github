We give real estate owners, operators, tenants, and visitors the tools they need to make parking easy. Vend takes a customized approach to each location to maximize revenue and provide a best-in-class parking experience.

Update rates, distribute monthly passes, view reports, and even open the gate anywhere and anytime. Eliminate manual processes so your team can focus on maximizing revenue and growing accounts.

By digitizing access and payments, parking can be marketed and sold in new ways. Create flexible passes that better fit changing work environments, sell subscriptions to increase retention, and provision sophisticated validations to drive more demand.

Customized hardware solutions are tailored to the unique requirements of each location. From gates to license plate recognition cameras and digital signage, we give you what you need to streamline multiple vendors and avoid capital-heavy upfront costs.

A configurable and self-service dashboard provides real-time operational insights powered by the 40+ data points we capture on every parking transaction.

- Revenue Strategy: Instantly access revenue data by rate type, day, time, tenant, location, and more.
- Utilization: Know who is parking at your facility and when, allowing you to optimize utilization.
- Marketing: Increase retention and drive demand with our powerful marketing tools.
- Seamless driver experience: Smart digital signage welcomes drivers with a customized workflow to walk them through the parking experience step-by-step, and even helps drivers resolve issues on their own.
